    <h1>The Cronton Gala and Music Fest About Us Page.</h1>
    <br>

    <p> The Cronton Gala Committee’s aim is to raise funds to support community events. 
        All funds raised by this brochure and other fundraising goes towards future events including the gala. 
        Over the years we The Cronton Gala have run events such as Halloween parties, Santa’s grotto, afternoon teas, VE and VJ day celebrations, easter egg trail, run competitions such as the scarecrow event and provided easter eggs and various items for the members of our community. 
        These are all funded from raffles, donations from other public advicates and also from various local major businesses who are very grateful to, and by the gala committee, who all work on a voluntary basis. 
        For more information on volunteering opportunities or to join our lovely team please use the Contact Us page to get in touch with us.  </p><br><br>
